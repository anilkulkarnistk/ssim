High Performance SSIM Parser for IATA Standard Schedules Information (Chapter 7)

Warning: This is still in alpha and can undergo breaking changes.

## Overview

This parser is designed to handle the Standard Schedules Information Manual (SSIM) file format, widely used in the aviation industry to manage and exchange airline schedule data.

## Record Types

SSIM consists of 5 different binary `Record Types` -

  1. Record Type 1 - [Header](./lib/ssim/header_record.ex)
  2. Record Type 2 - [Carrier](./lib/ssim/carrier_record.ex)
  3. Record Type 3 - [Flight Leg](./lib/ssim/flight_leg_record.ex)
  4. Record Type 4 - [Segment Data](./lib/ssim/segment_data_record.ex)
  5. Record Type 5 - [Trailer](./lib/ssim/trailer_record.ex)

## Running Application

1. Make sure [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) is installed.
2. Installation -

    ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/anilkulkarnistk/ssim.git
      cd ssim
      mix deps.get
    ```

3. Open terminal and start `iex`.

    ```bash
      iex -S mix
    ```

4. Inside `iex` call the `parse_ssim` function and pass your file path.

    ```bash
      iex(1)> file_path = "./sample/sample.ssim"

      iex(2)> SSIM.parse_ssim(file_path)
    ```

    No specific file `ext` is needed for SSIM file name, for example instead of `sample.ssim` you could have just passed `sample_file` or `sample_file.ssm`, the extension does not matter as the file is read as binary.

5. Parser writes the processed `SSIM` file as `json` file under `output` directory with `timestamp` as the file name, example -

    ```bash
      output/ssim_records_1727035431736.json
    ```

## Optimizations

The intention was not only to write a `Correct` but also a `High Performance` parser, so the following optimizations have been done -

1. Parser highly leverages `concurrency` primitives to parse data in `parallel`.
2. `I/O` stream is used to open and process the `SSIM` as well as output `json` file.
3. File is streamed in `16KB` chunks to maximise `CPU Cache`.
4. Data is batched in `5000` records to process at one time.
5. Actual record parsing uses highly optimized binary `Pattern Matching` instead of `Regex` or `Slicing`.
6. Write buffer is used to write batches of `5000` records to minimize `disk access`.

## Benchmarks

Some basic benchmarks running the parser on my laptop -

```bash
Operating System: Linux
CPU Information: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8565U CPU @ 1.80GHz
Number of Available Cores: 8
Available memory: 7.65 GB
Elixir 1.17.3
Erlang 26.2.5
JIT enabled: true

Benchmark suite executing with the following configuration:
warmup: 2 s
time: 10 s
memory time: 2 s
reduction time: 0 ns
parallel: 1
inputs: none specified
Estimated total run time: 14 s

Memory usage statistics:

Name           Memory usage
SSIM_Parser       112.95 KB
```

For large files (multiple GB's), I am consistently able to process more than **50,000 records/sec** on my laptop. For small files the throughput would be comparatively less as concurrency also has its overhead, but as the file size grows, so does the throughput as we utlizie CPU cores more efficiently.

Benchmarking is very subjective and experience would be different for everyone.
